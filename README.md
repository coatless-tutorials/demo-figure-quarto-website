# Demo Quarto Website with Figure Submodule

This repository demonstrates how to keep your main Quarto website repository lightweight by storing generated figures in a separate git submodule.

## Repository Structure

```default
├── _quarto.yml          # Site configuration
├── index.qmd            # Homepage
├── posts/               # Blog posts
│   └── welcome/
│       └── index.qmd
└── figures/             # Git submodule (external repository)
    └── post-figures/
        ├── plot1.png
        └── plot2.png
```

## Usage

This repository is designed to be used as the main repository of a Quarto website/blog project. Figures are automatically generated by Quarto documents when they are rendered with proper `fig.path` configuration into the `figures/` submodule.

### Clone with Submodules

You need to clone the repository with its submodule to ensure the `figures/` directory is included.

```bash
# Clone including the figures submodule
git clone --recursive https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/demo-figure-quarto-website.git

# Or if already cloned
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Local Development

You can view the Quarto website locally using the following commands:

```bash
# Preview the website
quarto preview

# Render the site
quarto render
```

## What's going on in a nut shell?

The `figures/` directory is a git submodule pointing to a separate repository. When you generate figures with Quarto, they're stored in the external figures repository, keeping this main repository lean and fast to clone.
